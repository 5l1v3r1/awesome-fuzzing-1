About this section. Optional. Keep this short and focus on the list.
### Open Source
- [American fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted binary.
